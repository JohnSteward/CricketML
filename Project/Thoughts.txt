Notes to self about data:
Innings data mainly includes more in-depth batting card for each batsman-bowler matchup, with number of balls, runs, 1s, 2s..., wicket,
which wicket, how they were out, dot balls, percentages, strike rate, extras, what ball people were out in

BallData is what I need to use to actually predict runs, given the situation: batsman-bowler matchup, batting partner, home or away
Want to predict "score", or wicket

How tf do I use all the data to then only predict from ball data input????
