Notes to self about data:
Innings data mainly includes more in-depth batting card for each batsman-bowler matchup, with number of balls, runs, 1s, 2s...,
wicket, which wicket, how they were out, dot balls, percentages, strike rate, extras, what ball people were out in

BallData is what I need to use to actually predict runs, given the situation: batsman-bowler matchup, batting partner, home or away
Want to predict "score" and, if dot ball, check for wicket, which I think will probably just reduce runs.
Or maybe just don't touch wickets, are there are ethical and game-changing implications when it comes to awarding
wickets, like a change in run-rate, or just the concept of being out "by formula". If it just reduces runs, but adds
to the wickets for the ML algorithm

How tf do I use all the data to then only predict from ball data input????

Hmm neither json datasets allow me to easily see how many runs/wickets the team is on at that point in time. Would need
to add it up as I went along, not sure if that's possible when I'm running an ML algorithm. This may have to be naive
in that case, just kind of looking at averages for that specific ball.

Looks like this only works on categorical data, so will need to encode the strings in order to use MCA.
