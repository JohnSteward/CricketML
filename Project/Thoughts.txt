Notes to self about data:
Innings data mainly includes more in-depth batting card for each batsman-bowler matchup, with number of balls, runs, 1s, 2s..., wicket,
which wicket, how they were out, dot balls, percentages, strike rate, extras, what ball people were out in

BallData is what I need to use to actually predict runs, given the situation: batsman-bowler matchup, batting partner, home or away
Want to predict "score", or wicket

How tf do I use all the data to then only predict from ball data input????


Create array of all player names, make separate dataframe for each player, with that being the feature vector (hand, run rate, average runs in each over,
    run rate per bowler (will need arrays of all batsmen then all bowlers), average weight(set, unset...) overall and per bowler,
    aggressiveness overall and per bowler)
Bowler vector: (hand, dot ball ratio, boundary ratio, delivery style, wicket+dropped ratio, 1 ratio, 2 ratio, 3 ratio (all overall and per batsman))
    This is gonna be long as shit
